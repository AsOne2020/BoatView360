## Description

BoatView360 is a Minecraft Fabric mod that removes the 210° view limit in boats, allowing full 360° camera rotation for players.

In vanilla Minecraft, players in boats have their view rotation limited to ±105 degrees, which can be inconvenient. This mod removes that restriction, allowing players to look around freely while in a boat.

## Features

- Removes view rotation restrictions for players in boats
- Allows full 360-degree view rotation for players in boats
- Compatible with multiple Minecraft versions (1.14.4 - 1.21.8)
