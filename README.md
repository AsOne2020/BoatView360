## Description

BoatView360 is a Minecraft Fabric mod that removes the 210° view limit for passengers in boats, allowing players to have full 360° camera control while in a boat.

In vanilla Minecraft, when players are sitting in boats, their view rotation is limited to ±105 degrees. This restriction can affect the gaming experience, especially when全方位 observation of the surrounding environment is needed. This mod removes this limitation, allowing players to freely look around while in a boat.

## Features

- Removes view rotation restrictions for players in boats
- Allows full 360-degree view rotation for players in boats
- Compatible with multiple Minecraft versions (1.14.4 - 1.21.8)

## Usage Instructions

- **Client**: Must install this mod to gain full view control
- **Server**: Optional installation. If the server does not have this mod installed, other players will not be able to see your view exceeding ±105 degrees
