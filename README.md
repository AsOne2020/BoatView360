## Description

BoatView360 is a Minecraft Fabric mod that removes the 210° view limit for passengers in boats, allowing players to have full 360° camera control while in a boat.

In vanilla Minecraft, when players are sitting in boats, their view rotation is limited to ±105 degrees. This restriction can affect the gaming experience, especially when observation of the surrounding environment is needed. This mod removes this limitation, allowing players to freely look around while in a boat.

## Features

- Removes view rotation restrictions for players in boats
- Allows full 360-degree view rotation for players in boats
- Compatible with multiple Minecraft versions (1.14.4 - 1.21.8)

## Usage Instructions

- **Client (Required)**  
  The mod **must** be installed on the client to enable unrestricted 360° view while sitting in a boat.

- **Server (Optional)**  
  Installing the mod on the server is optional.  
  However, to ensure everyone in multiplayer sees accurate 360° head rotations, **all three parties must have the mod installed**:
    - Your client
    - Other players’ clients
    - The server

If any party does not have the mod installed, only your own camera view will be affected, and other players will still see your head rotation limited to ±105°.
