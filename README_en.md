## Introduction

**BoatView360** is a Fabric / Forge / NeoForge mod for Minecraft that removes the 210° rotation limit for boat passengers, allowing full **360° camera rotation** while seated in a boat.

In vanilla Minecraft, players seating in a boat can only rotate their view within ±105°, which limits situational awareness. This mod removes that restriction and enables players to freely look around in all directions.

## Features

- Removes the boat passenger rotation limit, enabling full 360° view
- Compatible with the following mods:
  - [Immersive Aircraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-aircraft)
  - [Immersive Machinery](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-machinery)

## Usage

- **Client (Required)**  
  This mod **must be installed on the client** to enable unrestricted 360° view while riding a boat.

- **Server (Optional)**  
  Server installation is optional.  
  However, to ensure all players in multiplayer can see accurate 360° head rotations, it is recommended to install the mod on all three sides:
  - Your client
  - Other players' clients
  - The server

If any one of them is missing the mod, the 360° rotation effect will not be synchronized. Other players will still see your head rotation limited to the vanilla ±105° range.
