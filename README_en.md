## Introduction

**BoatView360** is a Minecraft Fabric mod that removes the 210° view limit for players riding boats, allowing full **360° free camera rotation** while sitting in a boat.

In vanilla Minecraft, the player’s view while seated in a boat is limited to ±105°. This restriction affects the experience when trying to observe the surroundings. This mod removes that limitation, letting you freely look around while on a boat.

## Features

- Removes view rotation limits for players in boats, enabling full 360° free camera rotation
- Compatible with multiple Minecraft versions (1.14.4 - 1.21.8)

## Usage

- **Client (Required)**  
  The mod **must** be installed on the client to enable unrestricted 360° viewing while in a boat.

- **Server (Optional)**  
  Installing the mod on the server is optional.  
  However, to ensure all players see accurate 360° head rotations in multiplayer, it’s recommended that all three parties install the mod:
    - Your client
    - Other players’ clients
    - The server

If any party does not have the mod installed, only your own view will be unrestricted; other players will still see your head rotation limited to ±105°.
